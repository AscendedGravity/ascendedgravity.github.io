### Name
Hey, I'm **Daniel** and if the URL above doesn't give it away my last name is **Spradau**. A weather nerd by day and just a nerd by night.

### Online Persona
If you've named to find this page through one of the many online communities I am apart of you may know me as **Ascended** or **AscendedGravity**.

## Online Interests
### Current
Right now my current interests revolve around AI and more specifically AI Art. Drilling down more, AI from the likes of [Stable Diffusion](https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion) and [MidJourney](https://www.midjourney.com/home/).

I'm also into games of the *simulator* variety. Such as, Microsoft Flight Simulator and American/Euro Truck Simulator.

### Past
Previously I was an administrator for a very large [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us) community and did a lot of creative development for it. I also am a former Creative Contributor for [IdleLands](https://idle.land/).
